## Installation
* First clone this repo by typing <br>
`git clone https://github.com/rawho/flipkart-scraper.git`<br><br>
* Go to the project directory by <br>
`cd flipkart-scraper` <br><br>
* Then install all the requirements for this project by <br>
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` <br><br>
--------
### Now the scraper is ready to scrap
just run `python3 flipkart-scrap.py`

* It will ask you for the url, There you have to give the url of the flipkart page that you want to scrap<br>
 for example : https://www.flipkart.com/search?q=mobiles&otracker=search&otracker1=search&marketplace=FLIPKART&as-show=on&as=off <br>
 This is the url to scrap mobiles.<br><br>
* Where Can I get this url ðŸ¤” ?? <br>
 Go to [flipkart.com](https://flipkart.com) , in the search box enter the product you want to scrap and seach for it. yeahhh you got the url ðŸ¥³ <br><br>
* If you are lazy to go to flipkart and find the url, You can just edit <br> 
 **q=mobiles** in the previous url by your product. **eg: q=laptops**
 -------
 Next it will ask you for the filename just give any name.
 Then you can see the magic.
 
 After all that you can see a **csv file** will be created in the same folder. you can open it and compare you products, and have fun

 ### Future Plans
 * Now it only supports flipkart, want to make to support other ecomemrce websites
 * Here you have to type the url, i think that is not good, change it from url to the name of the product 
 * Any graph or any visualization about the products, Which will tell us the best product to buy, based on price, ratings and something
